This plugin provides a start screen for Vim and Neovim.

It provides **dynamically created headers or footers** and uses configurable
lists to show **recently used or bookmarked files** and **persistent sessions**.
All of this can be accessed in a **simple to use menu** that even allows to
**open multiple entries** at once.

Sussify doesn't get in your way and works out-of-the-box, but provides many
options for fine-grained customization.

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

It works without any configuration, but you might want to look into the
